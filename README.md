# FashionMNIST
[Fashion-MNIST](https://keras.io/api/datasets/fashion_mnist/) is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000
examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve
as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same
image size and structure of training and testing splits.
